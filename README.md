# Attendance App

Welcome to the School Bus Attendance App repository! This mobile application, built using Flutter, serves as a solution to streamline the process of recording student attendance for school transportation services. The app aims to address the inefficiencies observed in the manual methods currently in practice.

## Problem Statement
Within the school and transportation ecosystem, certain companies provide schools with licensed buses, drivers, and conductors (student safety supervisors). These conductors are tasked with recording student attendance, which is then shared with schools and parents. However, the current process often involves outdated technology, leading conductors to resort to manual methods. Some conductors voluntarily convert physical records to spreadsheets, a laborious task involving managing numerous paper records daily.

## Solution Overview
The School Bus Attendance App seeks to simplify and enhance the attendance recording process by offering the following features:

- **School Management:** Add, delete, and modify schools.
- **Bus Route Management:** Within each school, manage bus routes including addition, deletion, and modification.
- **Student Management:** Under each bus route, manage student lists.
- **Attendance Recording:** Record and modify student attendance under respective bus routes.

## Feedback Request
Your feedback is invaluable in refining and improving this application. We welcome comments on various aspects including:

- **Aesthetics:** Design and visual appeal.

- **Product Design:** Overall functionality and features.
- **Security:** Data protection measures.
- **Code Readability:** Clarity and organization of the codebase.

## Future Enhancements
While the app is currently functional, there are several planned enhancements for future iterations:

- Implementation of authentication and access level system.
- Improved focus on user experience and aesthetics.
- Enhanced flexibility in managing student and attendance records.
- Refactoring of codebase to follow the Bloc Pattern.
